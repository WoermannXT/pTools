Image ID Generator
visID: Visual ID to identify visually similar images
8x8 mono image hash (64 bit)
imgID: Image ID to identify visually idebtical images
16x16 rgb bmp md5 hash (128 bit) 
datID: Data ID of image file to identify identical file
md5 hash of image file (128 bit)

Process:
The datID is calculated (md5 of image file).
Then the image is cropped to a 16x16x3 rgb numpy array. 
Transform to a mono 16x16 numpy array by adding up the rgb values. 
Reduce to a 8x8 numpy array by calculating the median of the 64 4x4 clusters. 
Calculate the 64 bit sequence by comparing each value with the next one in the serialized numpy array.
