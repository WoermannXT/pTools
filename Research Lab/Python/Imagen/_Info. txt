Image ID Generator
visID: Visual ID to identify visually similar images
    8x8 mono image hash (64 bit, hexstr 16 byte)
imgBMP: Serialized 16x16 rgb Bitmap (hexstr 768x2 byte) 
    A serialized string of the hex rgb xalues of the bitmap. 
imgID: Image ID to identify visually idebtical images
    imgBMP md5 hash (128 bit, hexstr 32 byte) 
datID: Data ID of image file to identify identical file
    md5 hash of image file (128 bit)

Process:
The datID is calculated (md5 of image file).
Then the image is cropped to a 16x16x3 rgb numpy array. Important to define the method of cropping, should be simple and,,, 
Transform to a mono 16x16 numpy array by adding up the rgb values. 
Reduce to a 8x8 numpy array by calculating the median of the 64 4x4 clusters. 
Calculate the 64 bit sequence by comparing each value with the next one in the serialized numpy array.
Return a dictionary containing the values.
